What is Sparrow?
	At Sparrow we believe that time is the most valuable thing we have. In todays fast paced world we seem to never have enough of it; well that does not have to be the case thanks to Sparrow's task management software. Sparrow allows you to create a personal task list and then push tasks to a global claim board that allows another sparrow to claim the task and complete it. This allows a single person to delagate there to do list and free there time up to accomplish personal tasks or take a day off and enjoy the beach on a sunny day. 

## Basic Usage
Login / Create and account, Create a task in your dashboard, Save it to your personal list or our claimboard, Once a task is claimed you will be notified and a live tracker will keep you updated on the progress of your task until completed.
